=======
Learn Dependency Injection with Angular Project
================

    In a separate terminal tab or window, run 
    ```
    ./scripts/web-server.js 
    ```
    to start the web server.
    
    Open a browser window for the app and navigate to 
    ```
    http://localhost:8000/app/index.html
    ```
    
    First of all, go through app.js, then services and finally controllers. Have fun learning , cause AngularJS is Magic :)
